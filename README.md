# Diabetes Analysis Project

This project is an analysis of diabetes datasets, aimed at understanding and predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on several health factors. The analysis involves data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building to predict diabetes outcomes.

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze a diabetes dataset and create a predictive model that can help identify individuals at risk of diabetes based on health-related metrics such as BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, and age. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis and preventive measures.

The project includes the following steps:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and data transformation.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing key features and understanding correlations.
- **Modeling**: Using classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict diabetes.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from [Diabetes dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set) and consists of medical records for female patients from the Pima Indian heritage. The data contains the following columns:
- **Pregnancies**: Number of pregnancies.
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration after 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg / (height in m)^2).
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function (a function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history).
- **Age**: Age of the patient.
- **Outcome**: Whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and analysis.
